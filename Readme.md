Our mission is to spread smile to all those people who loose their importance in their family. We want to reach to maximum people and want to make them realize that there is always someone for them all the time. This can’t be achieved overnight, it will require lot of hard work and never ending will power.We want to spread our work to different states and this will require lots of funds. We will initially take help from our college and then we will start publicizing it through various means. We will contact old age homes and will try to take their feedback.
